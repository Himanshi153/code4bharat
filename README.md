# code4bharat - Hyperlocal Surplus Marketplace 
# Introduction
Hyperlocal Surplus Marketplace is a web app designed to help stores, cafés, bakeries, and local food businesses reduce food waste and boost sales. The system predicts surplus stock, sets smart dynamic discounts, and connects nearby shoppers or local charities to claim products before they expire.

By rescuing surplus food, the marketplace saves money, reduces CO₂ emissions, and supports community kitchens and charities with fresh, quality food that would otherwise go to waste.
